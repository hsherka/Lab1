    "I found that the City of Seattle employee that makes the most money is Mami Hara, who is the general manager and CEO of Seattle Public Utilities and is paid $137.79 an hour. The employee that makes the least amount of money is Amy Bonfrisco, who works as a Civil Service Comissioner and is paid only $5.53 an hour.I also found that the everage hourly rate is approximately $39.59. This leads me to wonder how someone is paid almost $10 less than Seattle's minimum wage. It also leads me to question what specific factors may influence how much an employee is paid specifically for City of Seattle (ex. how much experience, education, past success in that job, etc.). These are all things up for further exploration in the future.  "
